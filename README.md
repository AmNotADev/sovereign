### Preamble (A)

The Sovereign "License" is an Open-Contribution license intended for Enterprise and Commercial products and organizations aiming to control their distribution and code ownership while accepting community contributions, code reviews, and issue submissions. The Sovereign license is in place to protect the product or organization, while averting the need for a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This license is primarily for use in a git environment.

The owner of this repository and officials acting on their behalf shall be known as "Holders" of this license. You, the "Member" or "Carrier," are a code contributor or distributor who are agreeing to the terms stated in this license and in the other documents of this repository. You will be expected to comply with all guidelines, assuming the Holders comply with the license requirements. 

Neglecting to read this license and/or the documents of a repository does not protect you against this license. All contributors and distributors and held to the guidelines as stated in this license and by the Holders in the repositories documents without exemption. You can find out the guidelines of which you are held to in either this document, the Readme.md, Contributing.md, or another document in the repository. 

All derivative licenses or agreements based off this license, and/or, forked from this license are not officially endorsed by or supported in this license. This license itself offers no warranties or copyright notices except those given by the owner of the repository. This license is an Open-Contributor License, similar to Open-Source but the owner of the repository retains full rights over ownership, distribution, and copyright. This license is intended to hold the Holder, Members, and Carriers accountable to each other via set Guidelines and Policies.

All guidelines set in the documents of this repository are upheld by this license, which can include allowing free distribution, no distribution, limited (to specific organizations) distribution, any style formatting, commercial usage allowance, no usage allowance, and requirements for code to be successfully committed and merged. This license is not restricting by itself in how the repository can be used, but the Holder must define their guidelines in a Readme and Contributing document. Quality Assurance and having a local copy of the code for editing or private testing are not behaviors that can be restricted by Holders of this license.

#### Compliance (B)

To be in compliance with this license, the Holder is required to comply with these following guidelines:

* The Holder is responsible for setting the policy of their repository, this license provides no regulations on Members and Carriers except as stated below.

* The Holder is responsible to manage their own internal structure and moderate their team members. The term Holder applies to all team members, but their internal structure determines seniority and the ownership of the codebase. The leader of the Holder organization or product has final say in all matters of the license and code.

* The Holder is required to provide all Members with Contributor guidelines in a separate file from the Readme, this file must include; Code Style Guide, License notice, and commit & merge requirements.

* The Holder is required to note their policy on Distribution, and list all approved distributors if applicable. This should be located in the Readme, Contributing, or another unique file. If a notice is not made anywhere, this repository does not support any non-Holder Distribution. 

* The Holder must provide 30 days notice prior to changing their policies on Distribution and Contributing. The Holder may make the changes, but 30 days must be allotted before these policies are upheld so all Members and Carriers have proper time to change behavior.

* The Holder must, if choosing to go closed-source, provide notice 91 days prior and make a note in all repository documents. Upon the 91st day this license will void and should be removed.

If the Holder is notified about a compliance issue, they have 15 days from the notice to correct the problem before the license is considered voided. Not complying with these guidelines forfeits all protections granted in this license.
