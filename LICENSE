PREAMBLE (A)

  The Sovereign License, "License," is an Open-Contribution license intended for Enterprise and Commercial products 
and organizations aiming to control their distribution and asset ownership while accepting community contributions, 
code reviews, and issue submissions. The Sovereign license is in place to protect the product or organization, while 
averting the need for a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This license is primarily for use in a git environment.

  All terms used in this license can be referenced by the GENERAL at the end of this license. This license itself 
offers no warranties or copyright notices except those given by the owner of the repository, "repository." The 
creators of this license are not responsible for any Holders that may use this license or required to update this 
license after each release. All warranties and copyrights must be noted by the owners of the repository using this 
license, we are not at fault for incomplete documentation by the Holder.

  The owner of this repository and officials acting on their behalf shall be known as "Holders" of this license. 
You, the "Member" or "Carrier," are a contributor or distributor who are agreeing to the terms stated in this license 
and in the other documents of this repository. You will be expected to comply with all guidelines, assuming the 
Holders comply with the license requirements.

  Neglecting to read this license and/or the documents, "Documents," of a repository does not protect you against
this license. All contributors and distributors and held to the guidelines as stated in this license and by the 
Holders in the repositories documents without exemption. You can find out the guidelines of which you are held to 
in either this document, the Readme.md, Contributing.md, or another document in the repository. Not reading these
Documents is considered neglectful behavior, and all contributions are considered an intentional act complying
with the guidelines stated in this document. 

  All derivative licenses or agreements based off this license, and/or, forked from this license are not
officially endorsed by or supported by this license. This license is an Open-Contributor License, similar
to Open-Source but the owner of the repository retains full control over asset ownership, distribution, and copyright.
This license is intended to hold the Holder, Members, and Carriers accountable to each other via set Guidelines
and Policies. 

  All guidelines set in the documents of this repository are upheld by this license, which can include allowing
free distribution, no distribution, limited (to specific organizations) distribution, any style formatting,
commercial usage allowance, no usage allowance, and requirements for assets to be successfully committed and
merged. This license is not restricting by itself in how the repository can be used except as follows, but the 
Holder must define their guidelines in a Readme and Contributing document. Quality Assurance activities and having 
a local copy of the assets for editing or private testing are not behaviors that can be restricted by Holders of this 
license, unless abused at any time for public or commercial purposes.

COMPLIANCE (B)

  To be in compliance with this license, the Holder is required to comply with these following guidelines:

    * The Holder is responsible for setting the policy of their repository, this license provides no regulations
on Members and Carriers except as stated below.

    * The Holder is responsible to manage their own internal structure and moderate their team members. The term
Holder applies to all team members, but their internal structure determines seniority and the ownership of the 
repository. The leader of the Holder organization or product has final say in all matters of the license and assets.

    * The Holder is required to provide all Members with Contributor guidelines in a separate file from the 
Readme, this file must include; Style Guide, License notice, and commit & merge requirements.

    * The Holder is required to note their policy on Distribution, and list all approved distributors if 
applicable. This should be located in the Readme, Contributing, or another unique file. If a notice is not made 
anywhere, this repository does not support any non-Holder Distribution. 

   * The Holder must provide 30 days notice prior to changing their policies on Distribution and Contributing. 
The Holder may make the changes, but 30 days must be allotted before these policies are upheld so all Members and 
Carriers have proper time to change behavior.

    * The Holder must, if choosing to go closed-source, provide notice 91 days prior and make a note in all 
repository documents. Upon the 91st day this license will void and should be removed.

  If the Holder is notified about a compliance issue, they have 15 days from the notice to correct the problem 
before the license is considered voided. Not complying with these guidelines forfeits all protections granted in 
this license. This license can be referenced against the root at https://github.com/For-The-Users/Sovereign/LICENSE

SYNOPSIS (C)

  This license should be included in all Distributed copies and Repositories, all assets distributed are 
provided as-in without any warranty except as noted by the Holder. 

  The intent of this license is to replace a CLA and allow more freedom over the limitations of the repository, 
Members and Carriers for the Holder. Any complaints with the license type or use of the license should be brought 
up with the Holder. We recommend avoiding using repositories licensed under the Sovereign license if you do not
agree with the contents of this license.

  In this License, the Holder;

    * Owns all assets contributed, without exception.
    * Agrees to notify Members and Carriers about changes to Distribution and Contribution guidelines 30 days 
prior to enforcing the new guidelines.
    * Agrees to provide a 91 day notice before going closed-source, including adding a note in the Readme and 
Contributing documents.
    * Will comply with the above guidelines in all cases, or forfeit the protections given by this 
open-contribution license.

  In this license, the Members and Carriers;

    * Relinquish all rights over contributed assets, without exception.
    * Agree to follow all Contribution and Distribution guidelines as stated in the repositories documents.
    * Agree to call out the Holder on anti-compliance practices or forfeit their right to dispute the 
protections in this license.
